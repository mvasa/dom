Three Envelope Game
===================

Game Setup:
There are three envelopes, labeled A B C
Exactly one envelope has a prize $$ (envelope was chosen randomly)
The other two envelopes are empty

Game Play:

I. Player makes a choice of A, B, or C

II. Host exposes one of other two envelopes as empty and discards it

III. Player may:
     (1) Keep original choice
     (2) Switch to other (unopened) envelope

Hypotheses:
(1) Player wins significantly more often using strategy (1).
(2) Player wins significantly more often using strategy (2).
(3) Player wins no more or less using either strategy.


Program Specification:
1. Put prize in an envelope chosen at random. (Setup)
2. Choose an envelope randomly representing player's choice. (I)
3. Remove an envelope not chosen that is empty. (II)
4.1. Make choice (1) to keep original -- record result. (III)
4.2. Rerun making choice (2) to switch -- record result. (III)
----
Compare results of using (1) with that of using (2);
if (1) has higher win rate, then hypothesis that (1) is best is true.
if (2) has higher win rate, then hypothesis that (2) is best is true.
if (1) and (2) are statistically equivalent, then hypothesis (3) is true.
